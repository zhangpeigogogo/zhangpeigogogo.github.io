abstract: Responsive structural colors have emerged as a transformative platform for next-generation optical technologies, owing to their tunable, pigment-free nature and potential applications in anti-counterfeiting, dynamic displays, and environmental sensing. However, existing fabrication strategies for responsive structure color often suffer from low design flexibility, limited scalability, and lack of programmability, severely restricting the realization of complex, multifunctional systems. To overcome these limitations, we present a machine learning-assisted 3D printing strategy for the fabrication of structurally colored devices with dynamic, multicolor visual outputs. By harnessing machine learning to model and predict the intricate relationships between structural color, printing parameters, and external stimuli (e.g., electromagnetic fields), our approach enables inverse design and on-demand generation of programmable visual patterns. This data-driven framework significantly enhances the precision, adaptability, and efficiency of structural color printing, paving the way for intelligent fabrication workflows. Moreover, the seamless integration of display and sensing functionalities in printed constructs allows for the development of self-adaptive systems capable of real-time environmental interaction and feedback. This study demonstrates the unique advantages of combining machine learning with advanced additive manufacturing to unlock the full potential of dynamic structural colors, offering a scalable route toward intelligent, multifunctional, and interactive photonic devices.
